# zmk-config

This repository contains my personal ZMK configurations for various keyboards.
Currently, the following keyboards are supported:
- [Corne MX wireless](./config/corne.keymap)
- [Totem wireless](./config/totem.keymap)
- [Rev57LP](./config/rev57lp.keymap)

## Keymap representation

Below representation was generated with [`keymap-drawer`](https://github.com/caksoylar/keymap-drawer) â€“ check out the automatically generated layouts using the [automated Github workflow](https://github.com/caksoylar/keymap-drawer/tree/main#setting-up-an-automated-drawing-workflow) for each keyboard in the [`keymap-drawer` folder](keymap-drawer/), which is always up to date with the config.
